### **Summary of Project Motivation**

This project is designed to **demonstrate my backend and microservices expertise** by building a scalable, feature-rich social media backend. Key motivations include:

1. **Showcasing Skills** – Implementing authentication, real-time features, media handling, and distributed systems.
2. **Learning Microservices and its patterns** – Breaking down functionalities (auth, posts, notifications) into independent services, implementing Saga and API Gateway.
3. **Best Practices** – Incorporating security (JWT, encryption), observability (logging, alerts), and CI/CD.

This project serves as a **portfolio piece** to highlight my ability to design and build a production-grade backend system.
